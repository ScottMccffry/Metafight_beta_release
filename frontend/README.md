# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Contexts
BlockchainContext.js: This file creates a React context for blockchain interactions. It's a placeholder for blockchain-related functions such as mintNFT, which would be implemented to handle NFT minting actions.

BlockchainProvider.js: This provider wraps the application and supplies the blockchain context to the rest of the app. It uses the ethers.js library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, providing functions like mintNFT and stakeNFT to mint and stake NFTs, respectively. It also listens for contract events, such as MintConfirmed, to handle mint confirmations.

SelectedCardContext.js: This context manages the state of a selected card within the application, allowing different components to access and modify which card is currently selected.

SocketContext.js: This file sets up a socket connection using socket.io-client. The decision to use a WebSocket connection instead of traditional polling was made to handle real-time updates more efficiently, such as the variation of odds for the equilibrium of the liquidity pool, which can change rapidly and should be reflected in the user interface without the need to reload pages.

UnifiedContext.js: This context combines authentication and wallet information into a single context to streamline state management across the application.

UnifiedProvider.js: The UnifiedProvider component uses this context to provide a unified state and functions related to user authentication and wallet connection. It handles user login, logout, wallet connection, and registration. The provider also checks if the user's wallet is connected and if the user exists in the backend system, prompting for registration if not.
